# IMAGE-BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional attendance management systems in educational settings suffer from various inefficiencies, including:
- Time-consuming manual roll calls that reduce instructional time
- Susceptibility to proxy attendance and human error
- Difficulty in tracking attendance patterns and generating analytics
- Limited accessibility to attendance records for students and instructors
- Administrative burden of maintaining physical attendance registers

## PROBLEM OBJECTIVES
1. Automate attendance capture using facial recognition to eliminate manual roll calls
2. Ensure accuracy by reducing human error and preventing proxy attendance
3. Digitize attendance records for efficient storage and retrieval
4. Provide natural language interface for querying attendance data
5. Generate attendance analytics to identify patterns and support intervention
6. Reduce administrative overhead through automation

## MOTIVATION
1. Educational impact: Maximize instructional time by eliminating time spent on roll calls
2. Technological advancement: Leverage facial recognition and LLM technology to solve real-world problems
3. Data-driven decisions: Enable instructors to make informed decisions based on attendance patterns
4. Student accountability: Create transparency in attendance tracking to encourage responsibility
5. Administrative efficiency: Reduce paperwork and manual processes for educational institutions

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES
The problem statement identifies the issues with traditional attendance systems, while objectives define specific, measurable goals to address these issues. They are not the same, but they are closely related:
- Problem statement = what's wrong with the current situation
- Objectives = concrete goals to fix these problems
